Generated: 2025-12-03

How to use with GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new public GitHub repository.
2. Push the contents of this folder to the repository root.
3. In GitHub repo Settings -> Pages, set branch to 'main' (or master) and folder '/ (root)'.
4. Your site should be available at: https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo (update _config.yml url accordingly).

Local preview:
- Install Ruby & Jekyll

Customize:
- Update _config.yml (site.url, social, etc.)
- Replace assets/images with your high-res logos and banners
- Replace scheduler link in book.md with your Calendly or booking URL
- Add blog posts to _posts/

Files included:
- index.md, services.md, pricing.md, about.md, book.md, resources.md, contact.md
- _posts/*.md
- _layouts/default.html, _includes/head.html, _includes/footer.html, _includes/schema.html

If you'd like, I can push this to a GitHub repo for you or provide a deployment script.
