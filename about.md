<!-- MY APPROACH -->
<!-- ========================= -->
<section class="section about-section">
  <h2>My Approach</h2>

  <p>
    Think of me as your personal Excel helper function.
    I’m here to clean up confusion, fill in the gaps,
    and help you <strong>SUM</strong> your skills quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I break concepts down into simple, clear steps so you always know the
    “why” behind the formula — not just the “what.”
    Whether you’re learning functions, building dashboards, cleaning data,
    or preparing for a new job, I’ll guide you through with patience and
    practical examples.

<!-- A BIT ABOUT ME -->
<!-- ========================= -->
<section class="section about-section">
  <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Before tutoring, I spent more than two decades solving business problems
    with Excel — forecasting, automation, analytics, reporting,
    and streamlining processes.
    I’ve also proudly served in the U.S. Navy and hold an MBA from
    the Jack Welch Management Institute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, teaching Excel is my passion.
    Nothing makes me happier than seeing someone go from
    “I hate spreadsheets” to “I can do this!”
